// not clear which is the correct transparent color.  (It is not 0, because this
// causes Road Blaster to mask the mpeg

// text.
// Colors 0-7 aren't set by Road Blaster at all.)  Color 7 is probably a safe
// choice, and appears
// to be unused by any of the games for visible black.

// wdo 2005-4-13:  color 7 doesn't work on linux unless the -nosound parameter
// is used (????)
